This package allows you to stream video from your Raspberry Pi Camera to an iOS device.
YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS IN stream.sh 
On the iOS device, you will need a developer license and the GStreamer SDK (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/ios/)
On the Raspberry Pi, follow the instructions from pi.gbaman.info/?p=150 to install the GStreamer software suite, but instead of using the code shown there execute the stream.sh from this repo on the Raspberry Pi.
